# Self Care Center

## Overview

How can I care for myself? One way is with affirmations and mantras!
Affirmations are thoughts of positive self-empowerment, meant to assert your self-worth.
Mantras are repetive phrases that are repeated again and again during mindfulness practices. Your challenge is to build an app that helps users remind themselves of their inherent value!

## WHERE

The webpage can be accessed [here](https://colefiscus.github.io/self-care-center/).

## WHAT

The Self Care Center is a web app that allows a user to receive a randomly chosen and generated message depending on their choice of either an affirmation or a mantra. Extra features include the ability to 'clear' a received message which rids the screen of a message while returning the calming meditation icon to the output section. All on-screen buttons are only possible to press after meeting their respective requirements. Also, built-in, is the feature that allows the user to cycle through all available messages of each type until they've seen them all without seeing the same one twice. After their options for a type of message are exhausted, they will be notified by alert that they will now start seeing repeated messages.

The design of the page is based on a given comp.

(*For Turing Instructor only: CYOA features completed - Error handling and clear button & User never sees a repeated message*)

## HOW

Technologies used include JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

**How to use**: When a user lands on the page they will be presented with a screen that appears like this:

<img width="1434" alt="Screen Shot 2020-10-15 at 10 05 58 AM 👁 " src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49926352/96159974-93c4c780-0ed2-11eb-9009-68501c2b5bd7.png">

The only thing the user will need to do is select either "affirmation" or "mantra" by clicking on one of the corresponding circles and then clicking the "Receive Message" button to be presented with a message of a type of their choosing. The user can continue to press the "Receive Message" button to receive additional messages of the selected type.

If the user wishes to start over, they can either refresh the page or click the "Clear" button that appears below the output box after receiving a message - this will reset the appearance of the application to how it appears upon page load.

## WHAT'S NEXT

With additional time, the next steps I'd like to see with this project is both the ability for a user to 'favorite' a message, for the user to be able to see a list of their favorited messages, for the user to be able to delete a message either from the available random messages and their favorited messages, for the user to be able to add a custom message to the available random messages, and for all of that information to be available upon page reload using local storage. After those features are implemented, I'd like to add more design elements including animations.
